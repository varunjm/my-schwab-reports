# my-schwab-reports

A Python script to process Charles Schwab CSV exports and generate consolidated tax reports for Indian residents with US investments.

## What does this do?

This script processes CSV exports from Charles Schwab accounts (Employee Stock Award Center/EAC and Individual trading accounts) and generates consolidated reports required for Indian tax filing:

- **Dividend report** - All dividend earnings with TDS details
- **Interest earned report** - Interest from cash holdings and savings
- **Sale report** - Stock sales with cost basis and gains/losses
